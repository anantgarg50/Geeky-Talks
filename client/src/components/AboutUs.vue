					One can almost find anything in their local around the corner shops but in this arena of such high 
					supply and produce the quality oftenly gets compromised and we end up taking home rice with mites 
					and chalk rich flour. Not exactly anyoneâ€™s idea of a delicious meal.
					<br>
					So here we are, your knight in shining armour, you rate your favourite stores and drop-dead stores 
					and share your own reviews and experiences with others and read theirs, thus coming up with a list 
					of the best and worst stores to spend your hard earned money on around the corner or around the country.
